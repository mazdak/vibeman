### Integration Test Coverage

- **8 integration test files** covering key scenarios
- Integration tests exist for:
  - Container lifecycle
  - Service lifecycle
  - Worktree lifecycle
  - AI container integration
  - WebSocket functionality
  - Git operations
  - Database operations
  - Configuration

## Critical Issues

### 1. Service Package (0% Coverage)
The service package is completely untested despite being critical for:
- Service lifecycle management (start/stop/health checks)
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Reference counting for shared services
- Complex concurrency logic with mutexes

**Risk**: High - This is core functionality with complex state management

### 2. Container Package (10.8% Coverage)
Very low coverage for Docker operations:
- Most Docker runtime functions untested
- Container creation, management, and cleanup barely tested
- AI container functionality has some tests but low coverage

**Risk**: High - Container management is core to the application

### 3. Server Package (24.6% Coverage)
API handlers have minimal testing:
- Most endpoints lack proper test coverage
- Error cases not well tested
- WebSocket handlers have basic tests only

**Risk**: Medium-High - API is the primary interface for web UI

### 4. Database Package (0% Coverage)
No tests for database operations:
- Repository CRUD operations untested
- Worktree management untested
- Service tracking untested

**Risk**: High - Data integrity and persistence are critical

## Areas with Missing Tests

### 1. Critical Business Logic
- `service/manager.go`: Complex service orchestration logic
- `container/manager.go`: Container lifecycle management
- `operations/service.go`: Service operations
- `db/repositories.go`: Data persistence layer

### 2. Error Handling
- Most packages lack comprehensive error case testing
- Edge cases and failure scenarios not covered
- Recovery and cleanup logic untested

### 3. Concurrency
- Service manager uses complex mutex patterns - untested
- No tests for race conditions or deadlocks
- Concurrent operations not validated

## Test Quality Issues

### 1. Over-reliance on Mocks
- Container tests use mocked Docker commands instead of real containers
- This violates the CLAUDE.md guideline for integration tests
- Unit tests appropriately use mocks, but coverage is low

### 2. Missing Integration Test Execution
- Integration tests may timeout (as seen during analysis)
- Suggests tests might be too heavy or have environment issues
- Need to ensure integration tests run reliably in CI/CD

### 3. Incomplete Test Scenarios
- Happy path testing predominates
- Error conditions, edge cases under-tested
- No performance or load testing visible

## Compliance with CLAUDE.md Guidelines

### ❌ Not Meeting Requirements:
1. **"Maintain test coverage above 80%"** - Most packages well below this
2. **"No feature is complete without both unit and integration tests"** - Service package has neither
3. **"Test error conditions and edge cases extensively"** - Limited error testing
4. **"Integration tests must be run and validated after each phase"** - Tests timing out

### ✅ Following Guidelines:
1. Proper separation of unit and integration tests
2. Integration tests use `// +build integration` tag correctly
3. Test organization follows recommended structure
4. Some packages (config) have good coverage

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Add tests for service package** - This is critical infrastructure
2. **Improve container package coverage** - Focus on Docker operations
3. **Add database tests** - Ensure data integrity
4. **Fix integration test timeout issues** - Tests must run reliably

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)
1. Increase server/API handler coverage to 80%+
2. Add comprehensive error case testing
3. Test concurrent operations and race conditions
4. Add tests for all CLI commands

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3)
1. Implement continuous coverage monitoring
2. Add performance and load tests
3. Create test utilities for common scenarios
4. Document testing best practices

## Summary

The vibeman backend has **critical gaps in test coverage** that pose significant risks:
- Core packages (service, container, db) have little to no testing
- Overall coverage is well below the 80% target
- Integration tests exist but may not be running properly

The testing strategy defined in CLAUDE.md is sound, but implementation is incomplete. Immediate action is needed to bring test coverage up to acceptable levels, particularly for business-critical components.
