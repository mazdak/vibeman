# Mac App Code Style and Best Practices

- **Swift 5.7+** targeting **macOS 14+** (use modern APIs).
- Avoid force unwrapping (`!`); prefer `guard let` and optional chaining.
- Use value types (`struct`/`enum`) by default; reserve `class` for reference semantics or bridging.
- Prevent retain cycles with `[weak self]` or `unowned self` in closures.
- Dispatch UI updates on the main actor or `DispatchQueue.main`.
- Keep functions small (≤ 40 lines) and single-purpose.
- Write concise comments only for non-obvious logic; favor self-documenting code.
- Follow existing naming conventions, file structure, and grouping.

## Testing

- Write **XCTest** unit tests for all new or modified logic.
- Cover edge cases, error paths, and concurrency scenarios.
- Ensure `swift test --parallel --enable-code-coverage` passes without failures.
- Keep tests deterministic and isolate external dependencies with mocks.

## Memory Safety and Concurrency

- Use Swift Concurrency (`async`/`await`) or Combine for asynchronous flows.
- Prevent data races: confine shared state to actors or serial queues.
- Clean up observers, timers, and resources in `deinit` or task cancellation.
- Annotate UI components with `@MainActor` when required.
